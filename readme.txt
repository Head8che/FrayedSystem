BASIC MECHANICS:
Your goal is to reach the end of the levels, avoiding detection by hostile Androids.
There are 2 types of androids - Vision Androids, with yellow vision cones, and Audio Androids, with white hearing ranges.
Vision Androids detect the player if they enter their vision cone, Audio Androids detect the player if they move inside their hearing range.
When an Android is alerted, they will chase the player, killing them if they touch the player.

HACKING:
The player has access to a hacking tool with 3 charges (recharges each level)
They can hack lights to temporarily reduce the detection range of Vision Androids and to reset them if they're chasing the player.
They can hack audio to temporarily reduce the detection range of Audio Androids and to reset them if they're chasing the player.
